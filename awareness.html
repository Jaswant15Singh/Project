                Let’s face it, accidents happen, but many can be prevented if we are safety aware when behind the wheel of a vehicle. The cost of an accident can be “mind-blowing.” There’s the cost of vehicle repairs, injuries possibly deaths, costs of property repairs, and probable increases to your insurance premium. Safe driving and training drivers to be safe can go a long way to keeping you and your coworkers safe and your premiums in check.

                Drive strategically. Avoid situations that could force you to suddenly use your brakes. Keep your head on a swivel looking for potential hazards.

                Don’t be distracted. Keep your eyes on the road and watch your mirrors. Know what’s going                 on all around you. Avoid eating, drinking, grooming, or rocking out to your favorite tune                 o                n the radio. Do not text or even talk on the phone while driving. If the phone                 conversation is really that important, pull safely off the road.

                Don’t drive while drowsy or under the influence. You are more likely to make driving                 errors when you are sleepy or impaired by alcohol or drugs (including over the counter                 cold/flu meds). Have someone else drive who is sober and alert.
