                Traffic management is the organisation, arrangement, guidance and control of both stationary and moving traffic, including pedestrians, bicyclists and all types of vehicles. Its aim is to provide for the safe, orderly and efficient movement of persons and goods, and to protect and, where possible, enhance the quality of the local environment on and adjacent to traffic facilities. This book is an introduction to traffic management, written in laypersons' language, and assuming no background knowledge of the subject. Various basic traffic characteristics relating to road users, vehicles and roads, and traffic regulation and control, are discussed, including some traffic volume and traffic flow considerations relevant to traffic management. For effective traffic management, it is essential that the practitioner works from factual information. Road inventory and statistical methods, and the more common types of traffic studies, including traffic volume and composition, origin and destination, speed, travel time and delay, accidents and parking are described.
